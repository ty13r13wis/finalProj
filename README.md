The question behind my analysis was to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The purpose of our analysis was to understand some of the characteristics of fraudulent transactions in Europe, as well as to develop a model that could be used to identify these transactions in real-time. This analysis could benefit credit card companies, banks, and other financial institutions like the European bank BBVA by helping them prevent fraud and reduce losses.
